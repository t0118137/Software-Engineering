# Software-Engineering
There are total of two main files: BST, GreatWall
They are both written in C++ to demonstrate my coding experience during University.

The BST contains lots of functions that are using in normal binary search trees,
including insert, find, remove, and look up function in list, map and unordered_map.

The GreatWall are programmed based on the following knowledge:
1. Create a data structure suitable for efficient searching.
2. Load the information from each brick into the data structure.
3.Create a data structure suitable for storing the resulting sequence of symbol names.
4. Arbitrarily choose one brick as a starting point, and insert the two symbol names into the result sequence, 
northern name followed by southern name.
5. Perform a search to identify the brick that comes next to the east, and, if found, 
insert the new symbol name from that brick at the back of the result sequence.
6. Repeat this step until the easternmost brick has been found.
7. Now return to the starting brick.
8. Perform a search to identify the brick that comes next to the west, and, if found, 
insert the new symbol name from that brick at the front of the result sequence. 
Repeat this step until the westernmost brick has been found.

Hope these files could show my basic knowledge to the C++ programming.
