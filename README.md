This is a file to demonstrate my code examples of Binary Search Tree in C++ during University.
The bst.cpp file contains lots of functions that are using in normal binary search trees,
including insert, find, remove, and look up function in list, map and unordered_map.
Hope these files could show my basic knowledge to the C++ programming.
